Sizing container based on mui box https://mui.com/material-ui/react-box/#main-content

You must use size prop to specify size

One of these values:
'extraSmall' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'

It is created only to restrict size of content
So you can put all box props except of maxWidth and sx props
